On the system with the colors and settings you want, run:

gconftool-2 --dump '/apps/gnome-terminal' > gnome-terminal-conf.xml
then gnome-terminal-conf.xml to your git repo.

Then on the other machines, run

gconftool-2 --load gnome-terminal-conf.xml

to set it.

Note that this method overwrites all settings. Try running:

gconftool-2 -R '/apps/gnome-terminal'

to see all the settings that will be affected.
